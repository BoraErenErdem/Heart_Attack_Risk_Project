# Heart_Attack_Risk_Project
In this project, I have prepared a detailed report on predicting and interpreting heart attack risk using various machine learning techniques and approaches, as well as the relationship between environmental features and variables with heart attack risk.
If you would like to review the project report, you can access it here. -> [Heart_Attack_Risk_Project_Report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19011931/Heart_Attack_Risk_Project_Report.pdf)
